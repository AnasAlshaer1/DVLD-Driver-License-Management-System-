# 🪪 DVLD – Driving and Vehicle Licensing Department Management System

## 🧭 Overview
The **DVLD Project** is a complete **Driving and Vehicle Licensing Department Management System** developed using **C# Windows Forms** and **SQL Server**.  
This system automates and manages the core processes of a licensing department such as:
- Managing drivers and their personal data
- Issuing and renewing driving licenses
- Managing driving tests
- Handling international licenses
- Securing data through a proper login system

This project was built as part of a practical learning journey to strengthen programming, database, and system design skills.
